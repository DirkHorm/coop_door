# Coop Door Control

The *coop_door* repo consists of three main scripts which are described in the following.
You are able to integrate these scripts in home automatization tools like OpenHAB, for 
which I will give a short introduction at the end of this readme.

## Technical requirements
* Raspberry Pi
* Raspbian
* Python 3.9

The scripts can also run under other configurations, but were only tested in the above environment.

## Config

The configuration of the scripts mainly takes place in the *config/config.ini*. Please find an example file named *config.ini.example*
in the *config* folder, rename it to *config.ini* and adapt the config params to your needs.

I think the config params are self-explanatory.

## Coop Door
The *coop_door.py* is the main script of this repo. It is responsible for opening, closing and stopping 
the coop door. If you only want to automatically control your coop door, use this script!
The script is controlled via Mqtt and is therefore losely coupled.

|MQTT Topic| Possible Values | Description                                                                                                              |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|garden/chickens/coopdoor|OPEN, CLOSE, STOP| The *coop_door.py* script is subscribed to this topic and reacts to the given value to open, stop or close the coop door |
|garden/chickens/coopdoor/state|*| Whenever a message was published to this topic, the *coop_door.py* script resets its control GPIO pins                   |


## Coop Door Buttons
This script is optional!

Additionally to the automatic coop door control, I installed buttons next to my coop door to control it manually. E.g. whenever I clean the coop
I want to do this not being disturbed by the chickens, so I close the door via buttons.

The *coop_door_buttons.py* is used as some kind of proxy. It takes the button presses and publishes commands to the mqtt topic. As we learned in the *Coop Door* section, 
the *coop_door.py* script will then listen to the topic and open, stop or close the coop door.

|MQTT Topic| Possible Values | Description                                                                           |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|garden/chickens/coopdoor|OPEN, CLOSE, STOP| The *coop_door_buttons.py* script publishes a message depending on the button pressed |

There's one specialty for the *coop_door_buttons.py* script: Because of problems I had that the script got "ghost button pressed" events, the door sometimes opened at night or in the early morning.
Therefore, I introduced a check that the door cannot be opened or closed between 7:30 and 22:00 o'clock.
In case you don't want this check, you currently must adapt the code at line 48 and replace
```
if earliest_open_datetime < current_date_and_time < latest_open_datetime:
```
by
```
if True:
```
Perhaps this will be removed in the future or being made configurable. Let me know if this is a use case for you.


## Coop Door Sensors
This script is optional!

To see my coop doors state and ensure, the door is closed, when I expected it being closed and open, when I expect it, I installed reed sensors to my coop door.
The sensors are installed at the lowest (closed) and highest (open) point of the coop door frame. A magnet is installed on the coop door.
The sensors are connected to the Raspberry Pi.

In my configuration the sensors are the single source of truth. Means, only if a sensor publishes the coop door was opened or closed, I really trust the state.

|MQTT Topic| Possible Values         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|garden/chickens/coopdoor/state| OPEN, CLOSED            | The *coop_door_sensors.py* script publishes a message whenever one of the coop door sensors were activated                                                                                     |
|garden/chickens/coopdoor/realtime-state| OPENED, RUNNING, CLOSED | The realtime state represents the real state of the coop door. When the sensors were activated it published OPEN or CLOSED; when both sensors were released, it publishes RUNNING |

Since for me it was a little bit of playing around to find the best bounce time for my reed sensors, I added a "test" script in the test folder named *bounce_time.py*. Before running this script, adjust the open and close coop door and the open and closed sensor gpio pins.
What it does is, it closes the door for *COOP_DOOR_DOWN_TIME* constants value seconds and then opens it for *COOP_DOOR_UP_TIME* constants value seconds.
Whenever the sensor was "pressed" or "released" an output is given.

## Installation
There are multiple ways of running the script(s). I installed all the Python libraries in a Python virtual environment.
In this example, the right Python version is already installed on the Raspberry Pi and the coop door scripts are checked out to 
```
/home/pi/coop_door
```
To install the virtual environment call the following command from your coop door script folder.

```
python -m venv coop_door
```
To activate the virtual environment run 
```
source coop_door/bin/activate
```
and run
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```
to update pip.

Next install the dependencies for the coop door scripts
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you can run the scripts with from the shell
```
python coop_door(_sensors|_buttons).py
```
For a productive use it of course make sense to run the scripts as separate services.

You can now use a client like Mqtt.fx to send messages to your script and check the logs what's happening.

Have fun!

### Setting Up Services
To run the scripts as services, you can use the following scripts which you must add in */etc/systemd/system* on your raspberry pi.

#### Coop Door Service
In my case and for the following instructions the Coop Door Service is called *coop_door.service*.
```
[Unit]
Description=Coop Door Control Service
After=network.target sysinit.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/coop
# Delay, so GPIOs are ready when script is started
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
# Run the script from the virtual environment
ExecStart=/pyVEnv/coop/bin/python /home/pi/coop/coop_door.py
Restart=always
Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"
Environment="PYTHONPATH=/home/pi/coop"
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
In case you use other directories/install path for your pyVEnv, you of course must adjust them before.

#### Coop Door Buttons
In my case and for the following instructions the Coop Door Buttons Service is called *coop_door_buttons.service*.
```
[Unit]
Description=Coop Door Buttons Service
After=network.target sysinit.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/coop
# Delay, so GPIOs are ready when script is started
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
# Run the script from the virtual environment
ExecStart=/pyVEnv/coop/bin/python /home/pi/coop/coop_door_buttons.py
Restart=always
Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"
Environment="PYTHONPATH=/home/pi/coop"
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Coop Door Sensors
In my case and for the following instructions the Coop Door Sensors Service is called *coop_door_sensors.service*.
```
[Unit]
Description=Coop Door Sensors Control Service
After=network.target sysinit.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/coop
# Delay, so GPIOs are ready when script is started
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
# Run the script from the virtual environment
ExecStart=/pyVEnv/coop/bin/python /home/pi/coop/coop_door_sensors.py
Restart=always
Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"
Environment="PYTHONPATH=/home/pi/coop"
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Enabling And Starting The Services
To enable the services, so they are respected by the raspberry pi, run the following commands once

*sudo systemctl daemon-reload*

*sudo systemctl enable coop_door.service*

*sudo systemctl enable coop_door_buttons.service*

*sudo systemctl enable coop_door_sensors.service*

Whenever you want to (re)start your services you can do it with the following commands

*sudo systemctl start|stop|restart coop_door.service*

*sudo systemctl start|stop|restart coop_door_buttons.service*

*sudo systemctl start|stop|restart coop_door_sensors.service*

Of course you only use one of the commands *start|stop|restart* without the *|*, depending which action to execute with your service!
